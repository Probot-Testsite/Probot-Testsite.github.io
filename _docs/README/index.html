<h1>Introduction</h1><p>If you've ever thought, &quot;wouldn't it be cool if GitHub could…&quot;; imma stop you right there. Most features can actually be added via <a href="https://docs.github.com/apps/">GitHub Apps</a>, which extend GitHub and can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks. Apps are first class actors within GitHub.</p><p><strong>Probot is a framework for building <a href="http://docs.github.com/apps">GitHub Apps</a> in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></strong>. It aims to eliminate all the drudgery–like receiving and validating webhooks, and doing authentication handstands–so you can focus on the features you want to build.</p><p>Probot apps are easy to write, deploy, and share. Many of the most popular Probot apps are hosted, so there's nothing for you to deploy and manage. Here are just a few examples of things that have been built with Probot:</p><ul><li><a href="/apps/allcontributors">All Contributors</a> - Easily recognize all contributions per the all-contributors spec</li><li><a href="/apps/approveman">ApproveMan</a> - Approves pull requests with safe changes for protected branches.</li><li><a href="/apps/auto-assign">Auto Assign</a> - Add reviewers/assignees to pull requests when pull requests are opened.</li><li><a href="/apps/auto-comment">Auto-comment</a> - Comments on new issues and pull requests based on your configuration.</li><li><a href="/apps/background-check">Background Check</a> - Notifies maintainers when new contributors who have been toxic in the past join the project</li><li><a href="/apps/boring-cyborg">Boring Cyborg</a> - Add labels on PRs based on the FilePaths & Welcome First time users & much more</li></ul><p>Check out the <a href="https://probot.github.io/apps/">featured apps</a> or <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aprobot-app&amp;type=Repositories">browse more examples on GitHub</a></p><p>Ready to get started?</p>
